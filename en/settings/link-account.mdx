## Overview

Account linking allows you to connect your SSO-authenticated account with a password-based account. This feature provides a seamless way to merge your login methods while maintaining security.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Linking Process" defaultOpen>
    1. Log in with your SSO account
    2. Navigate to Settings > Link Account
    3. Enter the credentials of your password-based account
    4. Confirm the linking process
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="info" title="Important Notes">
    - After linking, your SSO account will use the linked account's credentials
    - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) settings from the linked account will apply
    - SSO account information will not sync to the linked account
    - You can unlink accounts at any time to restore original access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="After Linking">
    When accounts are linked:
    - Login will use the linked account's credentials
    - 2FA settings from the linked account will be enforced
    - SSO login information remains separate
    - Account preferences and settings from the linked account take precedence
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="unlock" title="Unlinking Accounts">
    To unlink accounts:
    1. Go to Settings > Link Account
    2. Click "Unlink Account"
    3. Confirm the action
    4. Both accounts will return to their original state
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Account linking is optional and can be reversed at any time. Your original SSO login method will be restored after unlinking.
</Note>

<Warning>
Make sure you remember the credentials of your linked account, as they will be required for future logins after linking.
</Warning>
