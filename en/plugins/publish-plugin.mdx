## Prerequisites

Before publishing, ensure you have:
- A complete and tested plugin
- A public GitHub repository
- A valid GitHub account
- Github Cli installed [Github Cli](https://cli.github.com/)

## Publishing Process

### 1. Prepare Your Plugin

Before publishing, make sure your plugin meets all requirements:

1. Update your `plugin.json` with the latest version number
2. Ensure all required fields in `plugin.json` are filled:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-plugin-name",
     "author": "your-name",
     "url": "https://github.com/your-username/your-plugin",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "minAppVersion": "0.0.0",
     "displayName": {
       "default": "Your Plugin Name",
       "zh": "你的插件名称"
     },
     "description": {
       "default": "Your plugin description",
       "zh": "你的插件描述"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test your plugin thoroughly
4. Commit and push all changes to GitHub

### 2. Run the Publish Command

The template provides a simple command to handle the release process:

```bash
bun release:publish
```

This command will:
1. Build your plugin for production
2. Create a release package (`release.zip`)
3. Create a GitHub release with the package
4. Submit your plugin to the [Blinko Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/blinko-space/blinko-plugin-marketplace)

### 3. Behind the Scenes

The `release:publish` command uses [blinko-cli](https://github.com/blinko-space/blinko-cli) to handle the release process. Here's what happens:

1. The CLI validates your `plugin.json` and ensures all required fields are present
2. It packages your plugin's `release` directory into a ZIP file
3. Using GitHub's API, it creates a new release with your version number
4. The release package is uploaded to the GitHub release
5. An issue is created in the Blinko Plugin Marketplace repository to request publication

### 4. After Publishing

After running the publish command:
1. A new issue will be created in the [Blinko Plugin Marketplace](https://github.com/blinko-space/blinko-plugin-marketplace)
2. The Blinko team will review your plugin
3. Once approved, your plugin will be available in the marketplace

4. You can track the status of your submission through the GitHub issue

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. GitHub Authentication
   - Ensure you have proper GitHub credentials configured
   - Check your repository permissions

2. Version Number Issues
   - Make sure your version follows semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)
   - Version number must be higher than previous releases

3. Release Package Problems
   - Verify your release directory contains all necessary files
   - Check that the ZIP file was created successfully

4. Repository Access
   - Confirm your repository is public
   - Verify the repository URL in `plugin.json` is correct
