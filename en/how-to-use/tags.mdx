## Creating Tag Hierarchies

With Blinko's multi-level tags, you can create hierarchies that reflect the relationships between your inspirations. For example, you can have top-level tags such as "Work," "Personal," or "Hobbies," and then further subdivide them into more specific tags like "Project A," "Project B," "Travel," or "Art." This hierarchical organization enables you to navigate through your inspirations with ease and quickly locate the information you need.
