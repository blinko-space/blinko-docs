# Access Token Configuration

The access token is essential for connecting Blinko Snap with your Blinko server. This guide will help you set up and use your access token properly.

## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the Token
- Open Blinko Snap settings from the system tray
- Navigate to the "Settings" section
- Locate the "Blinko Token" field

### 2. Token Format
Your access token will be in JWT format, starting with `eyJ...`. This token is used to authenticate your requests to the Blinko server.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Copy the Token**
   - The token will be displayed in the settings panel
   - Copy the entire token string carefully
   - Make sure not to include any extra spaces

2. **Verify Connection**
   - After entering the token, Blinko Snap will automatically test the connection
   - A successful connection will allow you to start using the application
   - If connection fails, verify the token is entered correctly

## API Testing

If you want to test the API directly, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'http://127.0.0.1:1111/api/v1/note/upsert' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' \
-d '{
  "content": "ðŸŽ‰ Hello, Blinko! --send from api",
  "type": 0
}'
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Token Protection**
   - Keep your token secure and private
   - Don't share your token with others
   - Regenerate token if you suspect it's compromised

2. **Token Expiration**
   - Tokens may expire after a certain period
   - If you experience authentication issues, try generating a new token

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure the token is copied completely
2. Check if the Blinko server is running
3. Verify your network connection
4. Try regenerating a new token
